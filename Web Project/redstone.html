      <h3 class="ideas-title"> 1) Cobblestone/Stone Generator</h3>
      <div class="image-container">

      <p class="ideas-description">
        <br><br>
        The cobblestone generator is one of the most basic Redstone contraptions in the entire universe of Minecraft. It’s the must-have build in Skyblock mode and sometimes in normal mode as well.
        <br><br>
        The reason Generators are popular because they only required a bucket of lava, a bucket of water, and some building blocks. It is also very easy to build and super compact, not take a huge space in your Minecraft base.
        <br><br>
        With the setup like the image above, you need to put Hoppers below so the cobblestone won’t get destroyed by the lava. Maximize profit!

          <h3 class="ideas-title"> 2) Piston Door</h3>
          <div class="image-container">

          <p class="ideas-description">
            <br><br>
            When playing Minecraft, we’re all dream of the automatic door, right? What’s cooler than the door start opening as long as you take a step in!
            <br><br>
Piston door is the second favorite Redstone idea in the Minecraft community. Depending on how you set it up, it can be activated either by stepping onto the pressure plate or flicking a lever/button, this will trigger the Redstone and activate the piston to pull the block, reveal the entrance to your base.
            <br><br>
This Redstone build can be customized into different styles and sizes, you can make it big, small, reveal the entrance by row, or even by spiral effect,… Check Mumbo Jumbo’s video to find out how he makes a piston door from a 1×1 size to a 10×10 size.
            <br><br>
And you know what? Not only piston can be used to make doors, but it also can be used for a lot of other Redstone builds like the hidden staircase, TNT cannon, elevator…

      <h3 class="ideas-title"> 3) Super Smelter</h3>
      <div class="image-container">
       
        <img src="images/pistol-door.jpg.webp" width="40%" alt="supersmelter" style="float:right; margin:10px">

      <p class="ideas-description">
        <br><br>
        After a long mining trip (1-hour section of mining), have you ever had to open every single furnace in your base, put the coals and ores into them, and repeat the process over and over until your inventory empty?
        <br><br>
        Luckily, the Super Smelter is here to solve your problem! What you need to do right now is put all of your ores into 1 chest, and fuel into another, flick a lever and go breeding your animal while it cooks for you.
        <br><br>
        The idea behind this Redstone contraption is to make the minecart run back and forth, one deposit the ores while the other deposit fuel to the furnaces. The minerals then get extract by the hoppers below and get their way into the final chest. So in total, you can smelt up to 27 stacks of ores by only interact once.
        <br><br>
        Like most of the Minecraft Redstone ideas, super smelter may have a lot of different variations. It depends on how you need it and how much space you have in your base. If you do have at least 12 blocks wide wall, try this smelter design and let me know if it’s efficient.

          <h3 class="ideas-title"> 4) Flying Machine</h3>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/flying-machine.jpg.jpg" width="40%" alt="flying-machine" style="float:left; margin:10px">
          </div>
          <p class="ideas-description">
            <br><br>
            It’s a bird! It’s a plan! No… it’s a flying machine!
<br><br>
Instead of using normal transportation methods like walk, sprint, swim or fly, you can now ride a flying machine! With a simple design and a well-looking appearance, this Redstone machine will take you to the end of the world, without any fuel or troubles.
<br><br>
However, this machine has two issues. The first thing is if there is any block in front of it, the machine will stop, so you need to manually turn it on again. Ideally, you will want to make this machine high up in the sky.
<br><br>
The second thing is its speed, 4.44m/s, which is a little bit faster than the normal walking speed in Minecraft. But since you can just idle in the machine, this speed is acceptable and it is used quite a lot.
        <br><br>
            For this Redstone machine, you will need to go to the Nether to mine quartz and farm a lot of slimes balls. When you gather enough materials, the building process is pretty simple, check out this tutorial to make one!
        <br><br>    
           
          </p>

            <div class="ideas-item">
              <h3 class="ideas-title"> 5) Defense System</h3>
              <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/defense-system.jpg.jpg" width="40%" alt="flying-machine" style="float:right; margin:10px">
              </div>
              <p class="ideas-description">
                <br><br>
                If you are planning to do a 100 day series with the mob strength increase over time, this Defense system will be your best friend! With a single mouse click, you can turn on this monstrosity to protect your base.
                <br><br>    
                You can put any type of arrows or even a fire charge into those dispensers to make them shoot fireballs at the enemy. A single dispenser has 9 slots so the maximum projectile they can fire is up to 576 each!
                <br><br>
                The disadvantage of this Redstone idea is it uses a lot of materials, each Dispenser required two Observers to work. So if you’re building a 10×10 surrounding your base, it would cost around 80 nether quartz and 220 Redstone dust
                <br><br>

          <h3 class="ideas-title"> 6) Soda Machine</h3>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/soda-machine.jpg.jpg" width="40%" alt="soda-machine" style="float:left; margin:10px">
          </div>
          <p class="ideas-description">
            <br><br>
            Another relaxing purpose Redstone ideas from this list. With a simple and futuristic design, the Soda machine can fit well in any corner of your modern house, or even on the street.
        <br><br>
            The machine work as to how it’s intended in normal life, you choose your favorite drink and push the corresponding button, the dispensers below contain the specific flavor that will split out the bottle at your feet.
        <br><br>    
            The build is very straightforward and super easy to do, the only tricky part is when you use the piston to push the blocks down to the armor stand. Besides that, let’s go!

          <h3 class="ideas-title">7) Jump Scare Device </h3>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/jump-scare-device.jpg.jpg" width="40%" alt="jumpscare-machine" style="float:right; margin:10px">

          <p class="ideas-description">
            <br><br>
            This Redstone contraption is by far the most fun (or scariest) thing to build in Minecraft. You can use this to scare your friend and so on!
<br><br>
            Remember back in October last year, my friend and I were playing on a Minecraft server. Suddenly, he invited me to his custom haunted mansion base, so I followed. Later then, he challenged me to open his closet, and the white thing in a people shape just getting pushed in front of me with a large piston sound. Well… I jumped out of my chair!
            <br><br>
            Back to the present, this Redstone build is very easy to set up, but the hard thing is you need to prepare the atmosphere around it. Maybe you can build in a haunted mansion like my friend, at the swamp graveyard, or in a deep dark underworld
          </p>

        <div class="ideas-item">
          <h3 class="ideas-title">8) Elevator </h3>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/elevator.jpg.jpg" width="40%" alt="jumpscare-machine" style="float:left; margin:10px">
          </div>
          <p class="ideas-description">
            <br><br>
            We already have a lot of different horizontal travel methods, but is there any easy way for vertical travel? The answer is yes! This is why the Elevator is invented!
            <br><br>
            Back in the time when the Water elevator is not released yet, building an elevator in Minecraft was such a pain! However, some famous Redstone engineers have come up with a lot of ideas about it.
            <br><br>
            Redstone elevator has a lot of variations, some of which just let you go up and down at a specific height, the other can let you choose the floor, while the rest of them is to use ender pearls trick.
            <br><br>
            Nowadays, when magma block and soul sand block’s function has been developed, people are pretty much just going for the water elevator, because of its simplicity, compact, and aesthetic

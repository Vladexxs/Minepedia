        This is a very simple medieval house design that any player can build with the correct materials. Despite being simple, this house is absolutely stunning and will impress anyone who passes by.
        <br><br>
        The medieval styling in particular looks great, making this house a great touch for any survival world. The house is primarily made out of wood and concrete, making it inexpensive for players to create.

          <p class="ideas-description">
            <br><br>
            Yet another simplistic medieval house, this design is intended for those who have just started their survival world and perhaps do not have the materials to make a massive house yet.
            <br><br>
            It could also be perfect for those who desire to spend less time building, but would also like a great looking house. In any case, this house looks absolutely amazing and would not feel out of place within any medieval village.

        <br><br>
        This next design is for Minecraft veterans who want to go all out on their medieval Minecraft house build.
        <br><br>
        The house alone uses over 15 stacks of stone bricks and over 12 stacks of oak logs, so isn't cheap to construct by any means. However, the end result is completely worth all these materials. Players will have a truly remarkable mansion that towers over almost anything else.

            <br><br>
            This house offers a nice middle-ground between the massive mansions and the small houses. With it being within the sweet spot for size and build time, it will be perfect for Minecrafters at the intermediate stage of their Minecraft survival world.

                <br><br>
                Another functional but elegant medieval Minecraft house, this build was intended to be constructed and efficiently used within a survival world.
                <br><br>
                It makes use of sandstone and stone bricks for accents which helps it to stand out from other designs.

          <h3 class="ideas-title"> 6) Mountainside Castle Home</h3>
          <div class="video-container">

          <p class="ideas-description">
            <br><br>
            Mountains have become much more present in Minecraft after the massive Caves & Cliffs update. Due to this, mountain-themed builds have risen in prevalence in recent months.

This castle build by BigTonyMC uses a bevy of stone and deepslate bricks to create a cozy castle lodged into a mountain. The home itself is considerably spacious, and its connectedness to a mountain allows for an exceptional amount of expansion for players who don't mind doing a little digging.
            <br><br>
            Considering players will require plenty of stone to create this build anyway, hollowing out the side of a mountain will be a means to an end.

          <p class="ideas-description">
            <br><br>
            Farming is a vital component of Minecraft survival for the most part. This design by BuldTherapy keeps this in mind while still delivering a wonderful medieval home.
            <br><br>
            This build is rustic and functional with a brick roof, wooden paneling, and even a few vines for detail. It may not be particularly spacious, but it accommodates a large partition for farming. Complete with hay bales and carved pumpkin scarecrows, players can farm wheat, carrots, beetroot, and potatoes to their heart's content while maintaining medieval visuals.

          <div class="video-container">

          <p class="ideas-description">
            <br><br>
            Inns are another fixture in historical medieval architecture, and some still even exist to this day. This build by Dukeonred1 is one of the most elaborate inns the Minecraft community has likely seen. The texture pack used in this build also fits perfectly with the rustic look of the Middle Ages.

            <br><br>
            Once recreated, there's no doubt that players can come together and spend some time by the fire in this huge inn, which can clearly facilitate sleeping quarters for several players as they carry on their Minecraft journeys together.
